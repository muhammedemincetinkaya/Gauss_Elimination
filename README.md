# Gauss_Elimination
This program uses the Gauss Elimination method to solve a system of linear equations.                          (1 2 3
Convert the linear equations to a matrix or enter the matrix as it is using spaces and the "enter" key such as: 4 5 6
                                                                                                                7 8 9)
It will print the solution to the terminal.
